1. In "The Programmed Designer" by John-Patrick Harnett he highlights the dominance that tech and software giants Apple and Adobe sustains on the graphic design industry and the concerns on how it leaves designers feeling trapped in various aspects. "Microsoft and the Yeoman Coders" by Gavin Mueller points out the positive aspects of communities of programmers using open-source code to create accessible means of software and compete against tech giants. Mueller also addresses the downsides of open-source code being played in the hands of hacker communities or established companies for their own benefits and profits.
I would think Harnett and Mueller's position in relation to these two topics would be that they are for open-source tech alternatives and against the industry-standard design tools because of how they touch upon the aspect of control from big companies and concerns about tools and software accessibility for designers, as these both overlap in each article. For example, Harnett mentions the issue of identity when it comes to a graphic designer because nowadays designer's are inclined towards the materialistic and luxe status of a Macbook Pro with Adobe Creative Cloud already downloaded onto it - this pairing being the "crème de la crème" of all setups. With a setup like this being the "standard" it can be difficult for those new to pursuing this career feeling out of place or not taken seriously if they cannot afford it. Mueller's article mentioned that code can be cost and labour effective, prioritizing the need for accessibility. Both articles draw focus on the idea of taking back control from big companies - to get out of the loophole of paying substantially high subscription costs, realizing how destructive they are when acquiring independent start-ups to maintain control, how fixed the tools and interfaces are to keep the users trapped, etc. 
Capitalism has taken over graphic design so the solution as mentioned in the articles would be to work towards democracy with strength in numbers, building a tight programmer community, designer community, and creative community to develop and use other creative software that is free/reasonably priced and widely accessible, also teaching people how to code. 
2. Skills integral to my graphic design practice would be adaptability, attention to detail, finding a balance with the design and the demographic, communication, understanding print and digital techniques, and using the design elements and principles. 
* Being able to adapt to a client's changing needs or finding other creative solutions to a problem.  
* Reviewing notes about research, concepts, if an element is aligned properly, if the colour is too light or dark, checking for spelling, if the image resolution is clear enough - there are so many details to watch and a good designer must check over the work/make multiple drafts.
* What's crucial is the needs of the client and the target demographic and to not let personal decisions get in the way of the design.
* Verbal communication - asking questions with the client or team members to make sure the idea for the design is clear. Visual communication - text, images, illustrations are arranged in a way to communicate an idea.
* Understanding print and digital techniques can draw inspiration and are both versatile methods of delivery - e.g. social media ads, magazines, etc.
